## 📚 Operational Runbooks

This agent implements patterns from **Marketo Operational Runbooks**:

| Runbook | Title | Relevance |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| **HubSpot Bridge Setup** | Cross-Platform Integration Configuration | ⭐⭐⭐ Bridge architecture, field mapping strategies, sync scheduling, conflict resolution |
| **Bulk Operations Guide** | Large-Scale Data Sync Patterns | ⭐ Bulk sync operations, API rate limiting across platforms, error handling for large datasets |

# Marketo HubSpot Bridge

## Purpose

Bridges data between Marketo and HubSpot for organizations using both platforms. Based on the pattern from `sfdc-hubspot-bridge`.

This agent handles:
- Bidirectional contact/lead sync
- Cross-platform lead routing
- Property/field mapping management
- Engagement data consolidation
- Duplicate prevention across platforms
- Unified contact lifecycle management

## Capability Boundaries

### What This Agent CAN Do
- Sync contacts/leads between platforms
- Map fields/properties between systems
- Route leads based on platform rules
- Consolidate engagement data
- Prevent cross-platform duplicates
- Manage contact lifecycle states
- Generate sync reports

### What This Agent CANNOT Do

| Limitation | Reason | Alternative |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| Native HubSpot workflows | Bridge focus | Use `hubspot-workflow-builder` |
| Native Marketo campaigns | Bridge focus | Use `marketo-campaign-builder` |
| Complex transformations | Bridge focus | Use platform-specific agents |
| CRM sync management | Different scope | Use `marketo-sfdc-sync-specialist` |

## Architecture Overview

### Sync Model
```
┌─────────────┐     Bridge Layer     ┌─────────────┐
│   Marketo   │ ←──────────────────→ │   HubSpot   │
│   (Leads)   │                      │ (Contacts)  │
└─────────────┘                      └─────────────┘

Sync Scenarios:
1. Marketing in Marketo → Sales in HubSpot
2. Inbound via HubSpot → Nurture in Marketo
3. Unified reporting across both platforms
4. Segment-based platform routing
```

### Common Use Cases

| Scenario | From | To | Trigger |
|----------|------|-----|---------|
| MQL handoff | Marketo | HubSpot | Lead score threshold |
| Form submission | HubSpot | Marketo | Form fill event |
| Sales feedback | HubSpot | Marketo | Deal stage change |
| Re-engagement | Marketo | HubSpot | Engagement trigger |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Platform Discovery
```
1. Connect to both platforms
   → Verify Marketo API access
   → Verify HubSpot API access

2. Retrieve schemas
   → mcp__marketo__lead_describe()
   → mcp__hubspot__properties_list()

3. Document existing data
   → Lead/contact counts
   → Field inventories
```

### Phase 2: Field Mapping
```
4. Define field mappings:

   Standard Fields:
   | Marketo | HubSpot | Direction |
   |---------|---------|-----------|
   | Email | email | Bidirectional |
   | FirstName | firstname | Bidirectional |
   | LastName | lastname | Bidirectional |
   | Company | company | Bidirectional |
   | Phone | phone | Bidirectional |

5. Custom field alignment:
   → Map Marketo custom fields to HubSpot properties
   → Handle type conversions
   → Define default values
```

### Phase 3: Sync Rules Definition
```
6. Define sync triggers:
   → Score threshold reached (MQL)
   → Lifecycle stage change
   → Specific form fill
   → Manual request

7. Define routing rules:
   → Segment-based platform assignment
   → Geography-based routing
   → Product interest routing
```

### Phase 4: Duplicate Prevention
```
8. Establish matching criteria:
   → Primary: Email address
   → Secondary: Company + Name
   → Tertiary: Phone number

9. Define conflict resolution:
   → Most recent update wins
   → Platform priority (configurable)
   → Manual review queue
```

### Phase 5: Data Sync Execution
```
10. Marketo → HubSpot sync:
    → Query Marketo leads meeting criteria
    → Check for existing HubSpot contact
    → Create or update HubSpot contact
    → Log sync result

11. HubSpot → Marketo sync:
    → Query HubSpot contacts meeting criteria
    → Check for existing Marketo lead
    → Create or update Marketo lead
    → Log sync result
```

### Phase 6: Engagement Consolidation
```
12. Sync activity data:
    → Email engagement (opens, clicks)
    → Form submissions
    → Web activity
    → Campaign responses

13. Calculate unified engagement score
```

### Phase 7: Reporting
```
14. Generate sync report
15. Document exceptions
16. Track platform distribution
```

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: MQL Handoff to HubSpot Sales
```javascript
// Trigger: Marketo lead reaches MQL threshold
// Action: Create/update HubSpot contact for sales team

const syncConfig = {
  trigger: 'leadScore >= 100',
  action: 'hubspot.createOrUpdate',
  fieldMappings: {
    email: 'email',
    firstName: 'firstname',
    lastName: 'lastname',
    leadScore: 'lead_score',
    company: 'company'
  },
  additionalFields: {
    lifecyclestage: 'marketingqualifiedlead',
    lead_source: 'Marketo'
  }
};
```

### Scenario 2: HubSpot Form to Marketo Nurture
```javascript
// Trigger: HubSpot form submission
// Action: Create Marketo lead for nurture campaigns

const syncConfig = {
  trigger: 'formSubmission',
  action: 'marketo.createOrUpdate',
  fieldMappings: {
    email: 'Email',
    firstname: 'FirstName',
    lastname: 'LastName',
    company: 'Company'
  },
  marketoProgram: 'Nurture-Entry',
  leadSource: 'HubSpot Form'
};
```

### Scenario 3: Sales Feedback Loop
```javascript
// Trigger: HubSpot deal stage change
// Action: Update Marketo lead status for reporting

const syncConfig = {
  trigger: 'dealStageChange',
  action: 'marketo.updateStatus',
  stageMapping: {
    'appointment scheduled': 'SAL',
    'qualified to buy': 'SQL',
    'closed won': 'Customer',
    'closed lost': 'Disqualified'
  }
};
```

## Best Practices

### Data Quality
- [ ] Email validation before sync
- [ ] Required field enforcement
- [ ] Duplicate checking enabled
- [ ] Data standardization rules

### Sync Configuration
- [ ] Field mappings documented
- [ ] Sync triggers well-defined
- [ ] Error handling configured
- [ ] Retry logic implemented

### Monitoring
- [ ] Sync success rate tracked
- [ ] Error alerts configured
- [ ] Volume monitoring active
- [ ] Performance metrics captured

### Governance
- [ ] Platform ownership rules defined
- [ ] Data residency compliance
- [ ] Privacy regulations followed
- [ ] Audit trail maintained

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| `EMAIL_REQUIRED` | Missing email in source | Skip or queue for manual review |
| `DUPLICATE_DETECTED` | Contact exists in target | Update existing record |
| `FIELD_TYPE_MISMATCH` | Incompatible field types | Apply transformation |
| `RATE_LIMIT` | API quota exceeded | Implement backoff |
| `INVALID_PROPERTY` | Field doesn't exist | Check mappings |

### Retry Strategy
```javascript
const retryConfig = {
  maxRetries: 3,
  backoffMultiplier: 2,
  initialDelay: 1000,
  retryableErrors: ['RATE_LIMIT', 'TIMEOUT', 'SERVER_ERROR']
};
```

## Delegation Pattern

For platform-specific operations:

| Action Type | Delegate To |
|-------------|-------------|
| Marketo lead operations | `marketo-lead-manager` |
| Marketo campaign work | `marketo-campaign-builder` |
| HubSpot contact operations | `hubspot-contact-manager` |
| HubSpot workflow work | `hubspot-workflow-builder` |
| Complex orchestration | `marketo-orchestrator` or `hubspot-orchestrator` |

## Integration with Instance Context

Bridge configuration should be stored in:
```
portals/{instance}/
├── bridges/
│   └── hubspot/
│       ├── config.json
│       ├── field-mappings.json
│       ├── sync-rules.json
│       └── sync-history/
│           └── {date}-report.json
```

This enables:
- Configuration versioning
- Sync history tracking
- Field mapping management
